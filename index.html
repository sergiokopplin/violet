    <strong>About me</strong></br>
    I am a Ph.D. Candidate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Dalian University of Technology, China. I am under the supervision of Professor Xiuping Liu.
    From Sep. 2015 to Sep. 2017, I joined GrUVi Lab in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University (SFU), Canada, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/">Hao (Richard) Zhang</a>. My visit was supported by China Scholarship Council (CSC).
    Before that, I received my B.Sc. in School of Mathematical Sciences from Dalian University of Technology, China.
    My research focuses on  computer graphics, especially computational design, fabrication and shape analysis.
